# Frequently Asked Questions

## What does ES in ESFiddle stand for?

It stands for ECMAScript - the language on which Javascript is based off of. When the TC39 (Technical Committee 39), who manages what goes into the language of ECMAScript, introduce a new feature to the language, it is the job of the browser makers to implement it. Because this takes time and can vary across browsers we created ESFiddle to try out these new features before they are implemented in the browser.

## How does ESFiddle work?

It takes your code that you write on ESFiddle and runs it through the babel transpile library to convert that to Javascript that your browser can run.
